# Hosts

---

## Thanks

---

Thanks to [StevenBlack](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) for maintaining his vast list of hosts.

## Overview

---

The project simply filters the social network providers
from [StevenBlack's Social Hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/extensions/social/sinfonietta/hosts)
so they can be individually targeted for blocking. For example you may want to block `Facebook` or `Instagram` but
keep using `WhatsApp` and `LinkedIn`.

This project simply
downloads [StevenBlack's Social Hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/blob/master/extensions/social/sinfonietta/hosts)
and separates them into their various domains/providers for easier targeting by add blockers.

## Usage

---

To setup and run the project, you need to do the following (you must have `make` installed):

```bash
make run
```
